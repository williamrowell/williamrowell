## Hi there üëã

I'm Billy, a Bioinformatics Scientist at @PacificBiosciences. I primarily focus on improving our long-read variant calling applications and workflows. Before PacBio, I worked in neurogenetics, classical model organism genetics, enhancer-promoter interactions, and innate immunity. Sometimes, secretly, I miss the wet lab.

Find me on BlueSky ü¶ã [@williamrowell.dev](https://bsky.app/profile/williamrowell.dev) or on Mastodon üêò [@williamrowell@genomics.social](https://genomic.social/@williamrowell).  Sometimes I answer questions on ‚≠ê [Biostar](https://www.biostars.org/u/49414/). I've been lucky enough to collaborate on some pretty cool projects, and you can find the publications on [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7422-1194) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S8ixTQIAAAAJ).
